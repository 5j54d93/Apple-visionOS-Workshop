## SwiftUI

Using SwiftUI to demonstrate best design practices on visionOS, such as utilizing materials for backgrounds, applying vibrancy for colors, implementing hover effects, and more.

## Sky Sphere

Using Sky Spheres and 360-degree images can create an immersive environment. By applying image-based lighting with an HDRI image, the scene can achieve more realistic environmental reflections and lighting effects.

## Anchor

Demonstrating how to anchor 3D objects in the real world, including anchoring to surfaces such as walls, tables, floors, fingers, heads, and more.

## Snow Globe

Using Reality Composer Pro to compose many USDZ objects into a USDA snow globe, utilizing features such as particle emitters, ambient audio, spatial audio, point lights, directional lights, and more. Additionally, demonstrating how to send notifications to the main project and trigger timelines in Reality Composer Pro from SwiftUI.
